                <p>Mylove, Happy 4th Monthsarry. 

                    I do not need a special day like this to say how very much I love you. You are in my thoughts every day, and I cannot think of being without you.
                    
                    I remember an old song that says, "You make me happy," and you certainly do. There is nothing about you that I do not love--I love your hair, your voice, your eyes, the sound of your laugh, and especially the way you smile at me.
                    
                    I am the luckiest person alive to be able to call you my love.
                    
                    I love you when you are all dressed up.
                    
                    I love you when you are sad, and I love you when you are mad (but not as much).
                    
                    Sometimes I wish there were more minutes in the day so we could spend even more time together. Youâ€™re my greatest adventure and I love you so much.

                    I love you more than all the stars in the sky. Your beauty especially your smile make me fall more for you each and every day. Iâ€™m so lucky youâ€™re mine.

                    Happy 4th Monthsarry, my love.

                    I love you, see you on February 14, 2025.
                </p>
